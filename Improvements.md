That was a really fun assignment, thank you!

What i feel can be improved:
  * Better tests, more coverage;
  * Exception handling;
  * Make multiple robots present in 1 room. Trace movements of each, their position relative to the Room walls and to each other;
  * Better code structure - e.g a separate validator class for all inputs validation functionality;
  * Better input validation/handling;
